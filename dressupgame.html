                    <li><p>For the subject ‘inleiding programmeren’, which was all about learning the basics of JavaScript,
                        I made a dress up game where you find yourself looking at a character
                        and being able to customize their entire outfit, from skintone to shoes.

                    <li><p>During this project, I quickly made the decision to make a dress up game, since I’m a fan of fashion and wanted to be able to make a game like this in my own style.</p></li>
                    <li><p>All the visual elements are made in Adobe Illustrator, where I mostly used the pencil tool to create everything. Once all those elements were ready, I put them all in an HTML file and started positioning everything in CSS so it would all go into the right spot and I added hover states to make it all a little more smooth.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><img src="images/dressup/html_two.png" alt="Screenshot of code"></li>    
                    <li><img src="images/dressup/css_two.png" alt="Screenshot of code"></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>Once I was happy with all the placement of all the elements, it was time for the most challenging part: the JavaScript. This was the first time I was using JavaScript, so it took me a long time to figure out how to make sure the elements appeared and dissapeared when I specifically wanted them to.</p></li>
                    <li><p>I first made all necessary variables, for the elements and the buttons, and then continued on to make different functions and if/if else/else if statements. </p></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><img src="images/dressup/code_one.png" alt="Screenshot of code"></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>After this I made functions so the elements would be declared. Then I added eventListeners to all the different buttons, so the elements would actually change.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><img src="images/dressup/code_three.png" alt="screenshot of code"></li>
                    <li><img src="images/dressup/code_two.png" alt="screenshot of code"></li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>Since there were so many elements in the document, it took me a while before everything was working. But once it finally worked, I was very happy. The basics were done!</p></li>
                    <li><p>My next step was to add a few more if/else statements. When designing the clothes, I made three different outfits. When you click on the right clothes for one of the outfits, I wanted there to be a background change, and a sound. I made some more variables for the different backgrounds and the sound, and then added the functions with the if/else statements in them.</p></li>
