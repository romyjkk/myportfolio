                    <li><p>Since I’m mostly interested in Front-End Development, 
                        I decided to code my entire portfolio. This was going to be quite the challenge, 
                        since it has to be responsive so anyone can check it out on any device. 
                        It also had to look appealing and as professional as I could make it.

                <ul>
                    <li><p>I went to a portfolio event at my school a few months before this project, where they gave advice on how you should make your portfolio. I used a lot of the notes I made to make this portfolio, to add the right content. One of the tips we got, was to show the entire proces. Not too much, but enough for the reader to understand what’s happening and how you got to the end product.</p></li>
                    <li><p>I started the portfolio off using a lot of placeholder images and lorem ipsum text, but quickly started adding my own content and making it my own. What exactly to add was quite the struggle, I wanted to add just enough, not too much, not too little. I made sure there were a lot of visual elements, like screenshots and videos. This way the pages don’t look boring, and it’s also nice to see what exactly I’m talking about.
                        Under this I displayed some of the mockups I used.

                <ul>
                    <li><p>One of the biggest struggles I had in making this portfolio, was the amount of CSS I’ve written. It made it pretty hard to find anything. Luckily, I wrote some notes so I’d at least know where I was on what page. Because I had made multiple pages for different projects, the same elements kept being used which also meant the CSS I had already written would also apply to the new pages, even though I may not have wanted that specific rule to be applied. This is why I eventually started adding ID’s to pages. This did mean I had to copy a lot of code, since there was a lot of the same code in there.  It did make it a lot easier to position everything the way I wanted them to be positioned. </p></li>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>By making this portfolio, I got to practise a lot with the new stuff I learned in the months before I made this.
                        Especially making everything responsive on smaller and bigger screens. The apps and websites I've made in previous projects
                        were either for laptop or mobile only. In this project, I used a bunch of flexbox, grid and media queries to make everything
                        responsive, which was something I hadn't previously done. It's definitely something I'm very proud of.
                        Sometimes it took more effort than other times, but it paid off and I've made a responsive portfolio that also look aesthetically pleasing.
